/*
version pre-0.2

    *Version pre-0.1 is served with single file compression and decompression, applying huffman coding on each byte.
    *Plans:
    *    /Add more information to stderr output.
    *    /Separate different error codes.
    *    Change the parameters
    *        enable default output filename
    *        enable dictionary size control
    *    Design a file I/O interface (Actually it is essential for supporting big files.)
    *    Add error handling
    *    Separate the code into different files. (This might be done later, when the project gets more complex.)
